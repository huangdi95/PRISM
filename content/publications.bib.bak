  abstract = {We present a novel constructive proof for the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) specifically within the context of function fields over finite constants. Unlike previous existential approaches, our method utilizes the spectral interpretation of the Frobenius automorphism acting on étale cohomology groups. We explicitly construct the L-functions associated with algebraic curves and demonstrate that their zeros lie strictly on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2. This work bridges the gap between classical analytic number theory and geometric invariant theory, offering new insights into the distribution of prime polynomials. The constructive nature of our proof allows for the algorithmic verification of L-function properties for curves of genus g > 100, which was previously computationally intractable.},
