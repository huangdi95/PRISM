I am an Associate Professor at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS). I received my B.S. in Physics from Tsinghua University and my Ph.D. in ICT, CAS. My research focuses on automated chip design and code generation, with particular interest in **systematically training chip design foundation models and building practical chip design frameworks powered by these models**. I am also broadly interested in **Embodied AI**.

I am the lead contributor to the [CodeV series](https://yyyangzhao.github.io/CodeV-Series/), a family of fully open-source foundation models for HDL (e.g., Verilog) generation.
